Single Page Application in Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL and AngularJS.

In this project i am learnig how to make good web applications. I try to keep clean code (my first steps) and keep tests coverage above 95%.

This is application to manage snooker league. I try to make it very universal with many options. 

Heroku app: https://warm-savannah-7093.herokuapp.com/
